Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): Corrections and Clarifications
                  draft-bormann-core-corr-clar-latest

Abstract

   RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
   with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC
   7959, RFC 8132, and RFC 8323.  RFC 6690 defines the link format that
   is used in CoAP self-description documents.

   Some parts of the specification may be unclear or even contain errors
   that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability
   between different implementations.  The present document provides
   corrections, additions, and clarifications to the RFCs cited; this
   document thus updates these RFCs.  In addition, other clarifications
   related to the use of CoAP in other specifications, including RFC
   7390 and RFC 8075, are also provided.

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP        July 2024


1.  Introduction

   [RFC7252] defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
   with a number of additional specifications, including [RFC7641],
   [RFC7959], [RFC8132], and [RFC8323].  [RFC6690] defines the link
   format that is used in CoAP self-description documents.

   During implementation and interoperability testing of these RFCs, and
   in their practical use, some ambiguities and common
   misinterpretations have been identified, as well as a few errors.

   The present document summarizes identified issues and provides
   corrections needed for implementations of CoAP to interoperate, i.e.,
   it constitutes an update to the RFCs referenced.  This document also
   provides other clarifications related to common misinterpretations of
   the specification.  References to CoAP should, therefore, also
   include this document.

   In addition, some clarifications and corrections are also provided
   for documents that are related to CoAP, including RFC 7390 and RFC
   8075.

1.1.  Process

1.1.1.  Original text

   The present document is an Internet-Draft, which is not intended to
   be published as an RFC quickly.  Instead, it will be maintained as a
   running document of the CoRE WG, probably for a number of years,
   until the need for new entries tails off and the document can finally
   be published as an RFC.  (This paragraph to be rephrased when that
   happens.)

   The status of this document as a running document of the WG implies a
   consensus process that is applied in making updates to it.  The rest
   of this subsection provides more details about this consensus
   process.  (This is the intended status; currently, the document is an
   individual submission only.)

   (Consensus process TBD, but it will likely be based on an editor's
   version in a publicly accessible git repository, as well as periodic
   calls for consensus that lead to a new published Internet-Draft.)

1.1.2.  Proposed text based on IETF 117 and 2023-08-30 CoRE WG interim
        discussion

   This section describes the process that will be used for developing
   the present document (called "-corr-clar" colloquially).

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP        July 2024


   This process might be revised as its execution progresses.

   0.  (Done as of this a draft): include the present process proposal.
       The document can then already be considered for WG adoption.

   1.  Go through the following available material and revise/create
       Github issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/core-wg/corrclar/
       issues) as needed:

       *  Existing issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/core-
          wg/corrclar/issues)

          -  More to be opened by Jon Shallow regarding Block-wise, see
             JON-ISSUES (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-
             interim-2023-core-11-202307051400/#attacks-on-the-
             constrained-application-protocol-coap-christian-amsuss-jon-
             shallow)

       *  CoAP FAQ at the CoRE WIKI WIKI-FAQ (https://github.com/core-
          wg/wiki/wiki/CoAP-FAQ)

          -  Each point likely to become a new, short issue

   2.  Categorize the Github issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/core-
       wg/corrclar/issues) as to the topics they relate to, by tagging
       them.
       Completing a first round of this will be a task for a dedicated
       team.

   3.  For each issue or set of issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/
       core-wg/corrclar/issues), confirm with the CoRE WG and gather
       feedback from affected protocol designers/implementors if the
       issue is best to be:

       *  Included and covered in -corr-clar, as is or revised

       *  Simply omitted in -corr-clar

       *  Omitted in -corr-clar and left for a possible -bis document.
          (For example, this might be the case for some specific points
          related to RFC 7959.)

   4.  Reshape the -corr-clar document in order to reflect a sequence of
       pairs (Diagnosis, Therapy), where:

       *  Diagnosis is the gist of a set of Github issues to cover, and

       *  Therapy is the correction or clarification to address those.

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP        July 2024


       Even though at a high-level, the scope should be already clear by
       looking at the table of contents.  That is, at this stage, there
       is no need to necessarily elaborate the Therapy in detail, but it
       is necessary to make a reader understand "what we are dealing
       with and taking which direction".

   5.  WG document work can then focus on improving the therapy parts,
       until all points are satisfactorily addressed and documented.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   When a section of this document makes formal corrections, additions
   or invalidations to text in a referenced RFC, this is clearly
   summarized.  The text from the RFC that is being addressed is given
   and labeled "INCOMPLETE", "INCORRECT", or "INCORRECT AND
   INVALIDATED", followed by the correct text labeled "CORRECTED", where
   applicable.  When text is added that does not simply correct text in
   previous specifications, it is given with the label "FORMAL
   ADDITION".

   Where a resolution has not yet been agreed, the resolution is marked
   PENDING.

   In this document, a reference to a section in RFC nnnn is written as
   RFC nnnn-<number>, where <number> is the section number.

2.  RFC 7252

2.1.  RFC7252-1.2: Terminology (Request-URI)

   [RFC7252] uses the term "request URI" repeatedly, but only provides a
   vague definition in Section 5.7.2 of [RFC7252].  Text should be added
   to the definitions in Section 1.2 (Terminology) of [RFC7252].

   INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION (Section 1.2):
      Request URI:  The URI that identifies a resource on a server
         intended to be addressed by a request; constructed from the
         context of the request combined with Options present in the
         request using the process defined in Section 6.5 (Composing
         URIs from Options) of [RFC7252], see Section 5.7.2
         (Forward-Proxies) of [RFC7252] for further details.  Related to
         the HTTP concept of "target URI"; see Section 7.1 (Determining

         the Target Resource) of [RFC9110]; previously called "effective
         request URI" in Section 5.5 (Effective Request URI) of
         [RFC7230].

   PENDING.

   Note that a similar, but distinct concept is the "base URI", relative
   to which relative URIs are resolved.  This is more complex in CoAP
   than in HTTP because CoAP can multicast requests Section 8 of
   [RFC7252], expecting unicast responses; these need to be interpreted
   relative to the unicast source address from which the responses come.

   Section 8.2 of [RFC7252] has:

   |  For the purposes of interpreting the Location-* options and any
   |  links embedded in the representation, the request URI (i.e., the
   |  base URI relative to which the response is interpreted) is formed
   |  by replacing the multicast address in the Host component of the
   |  original request URI by the literal IP address of the endpoint
   |  actually responding.

   Similarly, Section 8.2.1 of [RFC7252] (Caching) says:

   |  A response received in reply to a GET request to a multicast group
   |  MAY be used to satisfy a subsequent request on the related unicast
   |  request URI.  The unicast request URI is obtained by replacing the
   |  authority part of the request URI with the transport-layer source
   |  address of the response message.

   Further discussion of a more generalized response concept can be
   found in [I-D.bormann-core-responses].

2.2.  RFC7252-5.10.5: Max-Age

   In the discussion of [RFC8516], a comment was made that it would be
   needed to define the point in time relative to which Max-Age is
   defined.  A sender might reference it to the time it actually sends
   the message containing the option (and paragraph 3 of RFC7252-5.10.5
   indeed requests that Max-Age be updated each time a message is
   retransmitted).  The receiver of the message does not have reliable
   information about the time of sending, though.  It may instead
   reference the Max-Age to the time of reception.  This in effect
   extends the time of Max-Age by the latency of the packet.  This
   extension was deemed acceptable for the purposes of [RFC8516], but
   may be suboptimal when Max-Age is about the lifetime of a response
   object.

   INCOMPLETE:

      The value is intended to be current at the time of transmission.

   PENDING.

2.3.  RFC7252-6.4: Decomposing URIs into Options

   [Err4895] notes (text updated with newer link):

   |  The current specification for decomposing a URI into CoAP Options
   |  (Section 6.4) is correct; however the text may still be unclear to
   |  implementers who may think that the phrase "not including the
   |  delimiting slash characters" means simply omitting a trailing
   |  slash character in the URI path.  This is incorrect.  See the
   |  discussion outcome in email thread
   |  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/
   |  vqOiUreodGXqWZGeGOTREChCsKY/
   |  (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/
   |  vqOiUreodGXqWZGeGOTREChCsKY/).

   [Err4895] proceeds to propose adding another note at the end of
   Section 6.4 of [RFC7252].  A slightly updated version of the proposed
   note might be:

   INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION at the end of Section 6.4 of
   [RFC7252]:
      Also note that a trailing slash character in the <path> component
      represents a separate, zero-character path segment (see the ABNF
      in Section 3.3 of [RFC3986]).  This is encoded using a Uri-Path
      Option of zero length.  The exception at the start of step 8 means
      that no such zero-character path segment is added for a trailing
      slash that immediately follows the authority (host and port).

         |  This means that for a CoAP server, no difference is visible
         |  between a request that was generated from the URI
         |  coap://authority/ and one that was generated from the URI
         |  coap://authority -- in both cases, there is no Uri-Path
         |  Option in the request.
         |  
         |  Note that this does not mean that a client cannot create a
         |  request with a single empty Uri-Path Option (which cannot be
         |  generated from a URI according to the algorithm given here),
         |  or that a server is compelled to treat a request with such a
         |  single empty Uri-Path Option the same way as one without any
         |  Uri-Path Option — the exception at the start of step 8 is
         |  only about generating CoAP Options from a URI.
         |

         |  Note also that there is a difference between requests
         |  generated from coap://authority/, coap://authority//, and
         |  coap://authority///, respectively: The first has no Uri-Path
         |  Options (due to the special exception), the second, two
         |  (empty ones), the third, three (empty ones).
         |  
         |  Similarly, for coap://authority/foo a single Uri-Path Option
         |  with the value foo is generated, while for coap://authority/
         |  foo/ that Uri-Path Option is followed by an empty one.

   PENDING: Enough examples now?

2.4.  RFC7252-7.2.1: "ct" Attribute (content-format code)

   As has been noted in [Err5078], there is no information in [RFC7252]
   about whether the "ct" target attribute can be present multiply or
   not.

   The text does indicate that the value of the attribute MAY be "a
   space-separated sequence of Content-Format codes, indicating that
   multiple content-formats are available", but it does not repeat the
   prohibition of multiple instances that the analogously structured
   "rt" and "if" attributes in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of [RFC6690] have.

   This appears to be an oversight.  Published examples in Section 4.1
   of [RFC9148] and Section 4.3 of [RFC9176] further illustrate that the
   space-separated approach is generally accepted to be the one to be
   used.  There is no gain to be had from allowing both variants, and it
   would be likely to cause interoperability problems.

   At the 2022-11-23 CoRE WG interim meeting, there was agreement that
   [Err5078] should be marked "VERIFIED", which was done on 2023-01-18.

   INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION:
      The Content-Format code attribute MUST NOT appear more than once
      in a link.

2.5.  RFC7252-9.1.1/9.1.2: (match boxing)

   Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 of [RFC7252] provide details about using
   CoAP over DTLS connections; in particular they restrict both message-
   id matching and request/response matching to within a single
   combination of DTLS session/DTLS epoch.








Bormann                  Expires 3 January 2025                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP        July 2024


   At the time, this was a decision to be very conservative based on the
   wide variety of security implications a new DTLS epoch might have
   (which also were not widely understood, e.g., for a re-
   authentication).  The normally short time between a request and a
   response made this rather strict boxing appear acceptable.

   However, with the Observe functionality [RFC7641], it is quite likely
   that significant time elapses between a request and the arrival of a
   notification that is sent back as a response, causing a need for the
   latter to use a different box from the original request.

   Also, additions to CoAP such as CoAP over connection-oriented
   transports [RFC8323] and OSCORE [RFC8613] create similar matching
   boxes that also do not fit certain likely use cases of these
   additions (e.g., with short-lived TCP connections as discussed in
   Section 4.3 of [RFC9006]).

   The match boxing semantics of the current protocol are clearly
   defined, but can be unsatisfactory given the current requirements.

   This calls for careful design choices and enhancements when
   developing extensions for CoAP or protocols and methods applicable to
   CoAP, such as in the following cases:

   *  As originally defined in [RFC8613], the security protocol Object
      Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) does not
      impact the CoAP matching functions based on Message ID or Token.

      At the same time, Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613] provides an example of
      key update procedure, which the two OSCORE peers can run for
      establishing a new shared OSCORE Security Context that replaces
      their old one.

      Furthermore, [RFC8613] tacitly assumes that the two peers
      terminate any ongoing CoAP Observation [RFC7641] that they still
      have ongoing, upon installing a new OSCORE Security Context,
      irrespective of the method used to perform a key update.

      On these premises, a belated response protected with the old
      OSCORE Security Context will fail decryption, due to that Security
      Context not available anymore on the receiving client.

   *  The recent key update protocol KUDOS
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] specifies how two OSCORE peers
      can establish a new shared OSCORE Security Context that replaces
      their old one, with a number of advantages compared to the method
      defined in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613].




Bormann                  Expires 3 January 2025                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP        July 2024


      Like OSCORE, KUDOS does not impact the CoAP matching functions
      based on Message ID or Token either.

      However, KUDOS allows the two OSCORE peers to agree on preserving
      their ongoing CoAP Observations across the performed key update.
      If and only if both peers agree to do that during an execution of
      KUDOS, will their Observations remain active after installing the
      new OSCORE Security Context, which the two peers will use from
      then on to protect their exchanged Observe notifications.

      Furthermore, irrespective of the method used to perform a key
      update, Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] updates
      OSCORE and [RFC8613] in order to prevent security issues that can
      arise from misbinding a request and a response, when those are
      protected with two different OSCORE Security Contexts.

      Such an update requires a server to include its own Sender
      Sequence Number as Partial IV of an outgoing response, when
      protecting it with a Security Context different from the one used
      to protect the corresponding request.  An exception safely applies
      to the response messages that are sent when running the key update
      procedure defined in Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613].

   *  The security protocol Group Object Security for Constrained
      RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) defined in
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] builds on OSCORE and protects
      group communication for CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis].

      Like OSCORE, Group OSCORE does not impact the CoAP matching
      functions based on Message ID or Token either.

      The management of the group keying material is entrusted to a
      Group Manager (see Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).
      In particular, the Group Manager provides the latest group keying
      material to a new group member upon its group joining.  Also, the
      Group Manager can distribute new group keying material to the
      members of an OSCORE group, by performing a group rekeying.  In
      either case, when receiving updated group keying material from the
      Group Manager, a group member uses it to install a new, commonly
      shared Group OSCORE Security Context, which replaces the old one
      (if any is stored).

      Also, Group OSCORE makes it possible for group members to safely
      preserve their ongoing long exchanges (e.g., CoAP Observations),
      also across the establishment of new Group OSCORE Security
      Contexts.  This is achieved by virtue of how the Group Manager
      assigns and maintains the identifiers of OSCORE groups (see
      Section 3.2.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

      Furthermore, analogous to the update that
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] makes on OSCORE with respect to
      protecting responses, Group OSCORE prevents security issues that
      can arise from misbinding a request and a response, when those are
      protected with two different Group OSCORE Security Contexts.

      In the same way specified in Section 3 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] for OSCORE, Group OSCORE
      requires a server to include its own Sender Sequence Number as
      Partial IV of an outgoing response, when protecting it with a
      Security Context different from the one used to protect the
      corresponding request (see Sections 8.3 and 9.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

   Furthermore, enhancements may be called for optimizations such as
   Eclipse/Californium EndpointContextMatcher [CF-MATCHER] might not
   work properly unless both sides of the communication agree on the
   extent of the matching boxes.  Mechanisms to indicate capabilities
   and choices selected may need to be defined; also, a way to define
   the progression of matching boxes needs to be defined that is
   compatible with the security properties of the underlying protocols.
   This may require new efforts, to be initiated based on some formative
   contributions.

2.6.  RFC 7252-12.3: Content-Format Registry

   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] established the CoAP Content-Formats
   Registry, which maps a combination of an Internet Media Type with an
   HTTP Content Coding, collectively called a Content-Format, to a
   concise numeric identifier for that Content-Format.  The "Media Type"
   is more than a Media-Type-Name (see [RFC9193] for an extensive
   discussion), i.e., it may contain parameters beyond the mere
   combination of a type-name and a subtype-name registered in
   [IANA.media-types], as per [RFC6838], conventionally identified by
   the two names separated by a slash.  This construct is often called a
   Content Type to reduce the confusion with a Media-Type-Name (e.g., in
   Section 8.3 of [RFC9110], which then however also opts to use the
   term Media Type for the same information set).

   The second column of the Content-Format registry is the Content
   Coding, which is defined in Section 8.4.1 of [RFC9110].  For
   historical reasons, the HTTP header field that actually carries the
   content coding is called Content-Encoding; this often leads to the
   misnaming of Content Coding as "content encoding".

   As has been noted in [Err4954], the text in Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]
   incorrectly uses these terms in the context of content types and
   content coding:

   1.  The field that describes the Content Type is called "Media Type".
       This can lead to the misunderstanding that this column just
       carries a Media-Type-Name (such as "text/plain"), while it
       actually also can carry media type parameters (as in "text/plain;
       charset=UTF-8").

   2.  The field that describes the Content Coding uses the incorrect
       name "Content Encoding".

   INCORRECT, CORRECTED:
      The VERIFIED Errata Report [Err4954] corrects the usage of
      "Content-Encoding" in the text and changes the name of the first
      column of the Content-Format registry to "Content Type" and the
      name of the second field to "Content Coding".  This change has
      been carried out by IANA.

   [Err4954] also has some notes on what would be valid or invalid
   Content-Format registrations.  These are not repeated here; they are
   however quite useful as a reference when preparing additional
   Content-Format registrations.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no new requests to IANA.

   Individual clarifications may contain IANA considerations; as for
   example in Section 2.6.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a number of corrections and clarifications to
   existing RFCs, but it does not make any changes with regard to the
   security aspects of the protocol.  As a consequence, the security
   considerations of the referenced RFCs apply without additions.

   (To be changed when that is no longer true; probably the security
   considerations will then be on the individual clarifications.)
