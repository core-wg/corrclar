Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): Corrections and Clarifications
                    draft-ietf-core-corr-clar-latest

Abstract

   RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
   with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC
   7959, RFC 8132, and RFC 8323.  RFC 6690 defines the link format that
   is used in CoAP self-description documents.

   Some parts of the specification may be unclear or even contain errors
   that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability
   between different implementations.  The present document provides
   corrections, additions, and clarifications to the RFCs cited; this
   document thus updates these RFCs.  In addition, other clarifications
   related to the use of CoAP in other specifications, including RFC
   7390 and RFC 8075, are also provided.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7252] defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
   with a number of additional specifications, including [RFC7641],
   [RFC7959], [RFC8132], and [RFC8323].  [RFC6690] defines the link
   format that is used in CoAP self-description documents.

   During implementation and interoperability testing of these RFCs, and
   in their practical use, some ambiguities and common
   misinterpretations have been identified, as well as a few errors.

   The present document summarizes identified issues and provides
   corrections needed for implementations of CoAP to interoperate, i.e.,
   it constitutes an update to the RFCs referenced.  This document also
   provides other clarifications related to common misinterpretations of
   the specification.  References to CoAP should, therefore, also
   include this document.

   In addition, some clarifications and corrections are also provided
   for documents that are related to CoAP, including RFC 7390 and RFC
   8075.

1.1.  Process

1.1.1.  Original text

   The present document is an Internet-Draft, which is not intended to
   be published as an RFC quickly.  Instead, it will be maintained as a
   running document of the CoRE WG, probably for a number of years,
   until the need for new entries tails off and the document can finally
   be published as an RFC.  (This paragraph to be rephrased when that
   happens.)

   The status of this document as a running document of the WG implies a
   consensus process that is applied in making updates to it.  The rest
   of this subsection provides more details about this consensus
   process.  (This is the intended status; currently, the document is an
   individual submission only.)

   (Consensus process TBD, but it will likely be based on an editor's
   version in a publicly accessible git repository, as well as periodic
   calls for consensus that lead to a new published Internet-Draft.)

1.1.2.  Proposed text based on IETF 117 and 2023-08-30 CoRE WG interim
        discussion

   This section describes the process that will be used for developing
   the present document (called "-corr-clar" colloquially).

   This process might be revised as its execution progresses.

   0.  (Done as of this a draft): include the present process proposal.
       The document can then already be considered for WG adoption.

   1.  Go through the following available material and revise/create
       Github issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/core-wg/corrclar/
       issues) as needed:

       *  Existing issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/core-
          wg/corrclar/issues)

          -  More to be opened by Jon Shallow regarding Block-wise, see
             JON-ISSUES (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-
             interim-2023-core-11-202307051400/#attacks-on-the-
             constrained-application-protocol-coap-christian-amsuss-jon-
             shallow)

       *  CoAP FAQ at the CoRE WIKI WIKI-FAQ (https://github.com/core-
          wg/wiki/wiki/CoAP-FAQ)

          -  Each point likely to become a new, short issue

   2.  Categorize the Github issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/core-
       wg/corrclar/issues) as to the topics they relate to, by tagging
       them.
       Completing a first round of this will be a task for a dedicated
       team.

   3.  For each issue or set of issues at ISSUES (https://github.com/
       core-wg/corrclar/issues), confirm with the CoRE WG and gather
       feedback from affected protocol designers/implementors if the
       issue is best to be:

       *  Included and covered in -corr-clar, as is or revised

       *  Simply omitted in -corr-clar

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


       *  Omitted in -corr-clar and left for a possible -bis document.
          (For example, this might be the case for some specific points
          related to RFC 7959.)

   4.  Reshape the -corr-clar document in order to reflect a sequence of
       pairs (Diagnosis, Therapy), where:

       *  Diagnosis is the gist of a set of Github issues to cover, and

       *  Therapy is the correction or clarification to address those.

       Even though at a high-level, the scope should be already clear by
       looking at the table of contents.  That is, at this stage, there
       is no need to necessarily elaborate the Therapy in detail, but it
       is necessary to make a reader understand "what we are dealing
       with and taking which direction".

   5.  WG document work can then focus on improving the therapy parts,
       until all points are satisfactorily addressed and documented.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   When a section of this document makes formal corrections, additions
   or invalidations to text in a referenced RFC, this is clearly
   summarized.  The text from the RFC that is being addressed is given
   and labeled "INCOMPLETE", "INCORRECT", or "INCORRECT AND
   INVALIDATED", followed by the correct text labeled "CORRECTED", where
   applicable.  When text is added that does not simply correct text in
   previous specifications, it is given with the label "FORMAL
   ADDITION".

   Where a resolution has not yet been agreed, the resolution is marked
   PENDING.

   In this document, a reference to a section in RFC nnnn is written as
   RFC nnnn-<number>, where <number> is the section number.

2.  RFC 7252

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


2.1.  RFC7252-1.2: Terminology (Request-URI)

   [RFC7252] uses the term "request URI" repeatedly, but only provides a
   vague definition in Section 5.7.2 of [RFC7252].  Text should be added
   to the definitions in Section 1.2 (Terminology) of [RFC7252].

   INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION (Section 1.2):
      Request URI:  The URI that identifies a resource on a server
         intended to be addressed by a request; constructed from the
         context of the request combined with Options present in the
         request using the process defined in Section 6.5 (Composing
         URIs from Options) of [RFC7252], see Section 5.7.2
         (Forward-Proxies) of [RFC7252] for further details.  Related to
         the HTTP concept of "target URI"; see Section 7.1 (Determining
         the Target Resource) of [RFC9110]; previously called "effective
         request URI" in Section 5.5 (Effective Request URI) of
         [RFC7230].

   PENDING.

   Note that a similar, but distinct concept is the "base URI", relative
   to which relative URIs are resolved.  This is more complex in CoAP
   than in HTTP because CoAP can multicast requests (Section 8 of
   [RFC7252]), expecting unicast responses; these need to be interpreted
   relative to the unicast source address from which the responses come.

   Section 8.2 of [RFC7252] has:

   |  For the purposes of interpreting the Location-* options and any
   |  links embedded in the representation, the request URI (i.e., the
   |  base URI relative to which the response is interpreted) is formed
   |  by replacing the multicast address in the Host component of the
   |  original request URI by the literal IP address of the endpoint
   |  actually responding.

   Similarly, Section 8.2.1 of [RFC7252] (Caching) says:

   |  A response received in reply to a GET request to a multicast group
   |  MAY be used to satisfy a subsequent request on the related unicast
   |  request URI.  The unicast request URI is obtained by replacing the
   |  authority part of the request URI with the transport-layer source
   |  address of the response message.

   Further discussion of a more generalized response concept can be
   found in [I-D.bormann-core-responses].

2.2.  RFC7252-5.10.5: Max-Age

   In the discussion of [RFC8516], a comment was made that it would be
   needed to define the point in time relative to which Max-Age is
   defined.  A sender might reference it to the time it actually sends
   the message containing the option (and paragraph 3 of RFC7252-5.10.5
   indeed requests that Max-Age be updated each time a message is
   retransmitted).  The receiver of the message does not have reliable
   information about the time of sending, though.  It may instead
   reference the Max-Age to the time of reception.  This in effect
   extends the time of Max-Age by the latency of the packet.  This
   extension was deemed acceptable for the purposes of [RFC8516], but
   may be suboptimal when Max-Age is about the lifetime of a response
   object.

   INCOMPLETE:
      The value is intended to be current at the time of transmission.

   PENDING.

2.3.  RFC7252-6.4: Decomposing URIs into Options

   [Err4895] notes (text updated with newer link):

   |  The current specification for decomposing a URI into CoAP Options
   |  (Section 6.4) is correct; however the text may still be unclear to
   |  implementers who may think that the phrase "not including the
   |  delimiting slash characters" means simply omitting a trailing
   |  slash character in the URI path.  This is incorrect.  See the
   |  discussion outcome in email thread
   |  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/
   |  vqOiUreodGXqWZGeGOTREChCsKY/
   |  (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/
   |  vqOiUreodGXqWZGeGOTREChCsKY/).

   [Err4895] proceeds to propose adding another note at the end of
   Section 6.4 of [RFC7252].  A slightly updated version of the proposed
   note might be:

   FORMAL ADDITION at the end of Section 6.4 of [RFC7252]:
      Also note that a trailing slash character in the <path> component
      represents a separate, zero-character path segment (see the ABNF
      in Section 3.3 of [RFC3986]).  This is encoded using a Uri-Path
      Option of zero length.  The exception at the start of step 8 means
      that no such zero-character path segment is added for a trailing
      slash that immediately follows the authority (host and port).

         |  This exception means that, for a CoAP server, no difference
         |  is visible between a request that was generated from the URI
         |  coap://authority/ and one that was generated from the URI
         |  coap://authority — in both cases, there is no Uri-Path
         |  Option in the request.  (The URI continues to be parsed as
         |  defined: e.g., for the URIs coap://authority/? and
         |  coap://authority?, there is no Uri-Path Option but a single
         |  Uri-Query Option that carries an empty query component.)
         |  
         |  Note that the exception at the start of step 8 does not mean
         |  that a client cannot create a request with a single empty
         |  Uri-Path Option; such a request just cannot be generated
         |  from a URI because of the algorithm given here.  It also
         |  does not mean that a server is compelled to treat a request
         |  with such a single empty Uri-Path Option in the same way as
         |  one without any Uri-Path Option — the exception at the start
         |  of step 8 is only about the process of generating a sequence
         |  of CoAP Options from a URI.
         |  
         |  The exception only applies to initial Uri-Path Options.  So
         |  for coap://authority/foo, a single Uri-Path Option with the
         |  value foo is generated, while for coap://authority/foo/ that
         |  Uri-Path Option is followed by an empty Uri-Path Option (an
         |  established idiom for a collection resource).
         |  
         |  Similarly, there is a difference between requests generated
         |  from coap://authority/, coap://authority//, and
         |  coap://authority///, respectively: The first has no Uri-Path
         |  Options (due to the special exception); the second, two
         |  (empty ones); the third, three (empty ones).  No server is
         |  compelled to offer resources under URIs with multiple empty
         |  path name components, which would generally be considered
         |  weird.

2.4.  RFC7252-7.2.1: "ct" Attribute (content-format code)

   As has been noted in [Err5078], there is no information in [RFC7252]
   about whether the "ct" target attribute can be present multiply or
   not.

   The text does indicate that the value of the attribute MAY be "a
   space-separated sequence of Content-Format codes, indicating that
   multiple content-formats are available", but it does not repeat the
   prohibition of multiple instances that the analogously structured
   "rt" and "if" attributes in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of [RFC6690] have.

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


   This appears to be an oversight.  Published examples in Section 4.1
   of [RFC9148] and Section 4.3 of [RFC9176] further illustrate that the
   space-separated approach is generally accepted to be the one to be
   used.  There is no gain to be had from allowing both variants, and it
   would be likely to cause interoperability problems.

   At the 2022-11-23 CoRE WG interim meeting, there was agreement that
   [Err5078] should be marked "VERIFIED", which was done on 2023-01-18.

   INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION:
      The Content-Format code attribute MUST NOT appear more than once
      in a link.

2.5.  RFC7252-9.1.1/9.1.2: (match boxing)

   Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 of [RFC7252] provide details about using
   CoAP over DTLS connections; in particular they restrict both message-
   id matching and request/response matching to within a single
   combination of DTLS session/DTLS epoch.

   At the time, this was a decision to be very conservative based on the
   wide variety of security implications a new DTLS epoch might have
   (which also were not widely understood, e.g., for a re-
   authentication).  The normally short time between a request and a
   response made this rather strict boxing appear acceptable.

   However, with the Observe functionality [RFC7641], it is quite likely
   that significant time elapses between a request and the arrival of a
   notification that is sent back as a response, causing a need for the
   latter to use a different box from the original request.

   Also, additions to CoAP such as CoAP over connection-oriented
   transports [RFC8323] and OSCORE [RFC8613] create similar matching
   boxes that also do not fit certain likely use cases of these
   additions (e.g., with short-lived TCP connections as discussed in
   Section 4.3 of [RFC9006]).

   The match boxing semantics of the current protocol are clearly
   defined, but can be unsatisfactory given the current requirements.

   This calls for careful design choices and enhancements when
   developing extensions for CoAP or protocols and methods applicable to
   CoAP, such as in the cases overviewed in the following Section 2.5.2
   and Section 2.5.3.

2.5.1.  DTLS with Connection ID

   PENDING:

      |  Protocol mechanisms that have been defined for stitching
      |  together connections or phases of an underlying connection,
      |  such as Connection Identifiers for DTLS 1.2 [RFC9146], may
      |  enable keeping the session/epoch unchanged and even to change
      |  the transport address (ip-address/port), once appropriately
      |  modified match boxing rules are specified for the stitching
      |  mechanism.  (These rules either need to be defined to be
      |  implicitly active for any use of the mechanism or they may
      |  require negotiation.)

2.5.2.  OSCORE, KUDOS, and Group OSCORE

   The security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful
   Environments (OSCORE) defined in [RFC8613] provides end-to-end
   security for CoAP messages at the application level, by using CBOR
   Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052].  In order to protect
   their communications, two peers need to have already established an
   OSCORE Security Context.

   Appendix B.2 of [RFC8613] provides an example for a key update
   procedure, which two OSCORE peers can run for establishing a new
   shared OSCORE Security Context that replaces their old one.  The
   recent key update protocol KUDOS [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update]
   specifies how two OSCORE peers can establish a new shared OSCORE
   Security Context that replaces their old one, with a number of
   advantages compared to the method defined in Appendix B.2 of
   [RFC8613].

   The security protocol Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful
   Environments (Group OSCORE) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] builds on OSCORE and protects group
   communication for CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis].  The management
   of the group keying material is entrusted to a Group Manager (see
   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]), which provides the
   latest group keying material to a new group member upon its group
   joining, and can update the group keying material by performing a
   group rekeying.

   The following discusses how OSCORE, KUDOS, and Group OSCORE position
   themselves with respect to the match boxing, the transport used
   underlying CoAP, and the renewal of the keying material.

2.5.2.1.  Match Boxing

   The security processing of (Group) OSCORE is agnostic of the value
   assumed by the CoAP Token and Message ID.  Also, (Group) OSCORE can
   be seamlessly used in the presence of (cross-)proxies that will
   change the value of the CoAP Token and Message ID on the different
   communication legs.  This does not affect the security processing at
   the (Group) OSCORE endpoints.

   Before any security processing is performed, the only use that
   (Group) OSCORE makes of the Token value is on the CoAP client upon
   receiving a response, in order to retrieve the right Security Context
   to use for decrypting and verifying the response.

   Even in case the Token value in a CoAP response is manipulated to
   induce a Request-Response matching at the client, there is no risk
   for the client to successfully decrypt the response instead of
   failing as expected.  This is because, per Section 12.3 of [RFC8613],
   the OSCORE Master Secret of each OSCORE Security Context is required
   not only to be secret, but also to have a good amount of randomness.

   Building on that, an HKDF is used to derive the actual encryption
   keys from the Master Secret and, optionally, from an additional
   Master Salt.  Furthermore, for each OSCORE Security Context, the
   quartet (Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context, Sender ID) must be
   unique.  As per Section 3.3 of [RFC8613], this is a hard requirement
   and guarantees unique (key, nonce) pairs for the AEAD algorithm used.

   In Group OSCORE, the Security Context extends that of OSCORE, and the
   same as above holds (see Sections 2, 2.2, and 13.11 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

   Finally, (Group) OSCORE performs a separate secure match boxing under
   its own control, by cryptographically binding each protected request
   with all the corresponding protected responses.  This is achieved by
   means of the COSE external_aad involved during the security
   processing of protected messages (see Section 5.4 of [RFC8613] and
   Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

2.5.2.2.  Underlying Transport

   The security protocol (Group) OSCORE does not have any requirement on
   binding the Security Context in use to specific addressing
   information used by the transport protocol underlying CoAP.  What
   occurs below (Group) OSCORE with transport-specific addressing
   information is transparent to (Group) OSCORE, but it needs to work
   well enough to ensure that received data is delivered to (Group)
   OSCORE for security processing.



Bormann                  Expires 28 August 2025                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


   Consistent with the above, (Group) OSCORE does not interfere with any
   low-layer, transport specific information.  Instead, it entrusts data
   to a Request-Response exchange mechanism that can rely on different
   means to enforce the Request-Response matching at the transport level
   (e.g., the 5-tuple, the CoAP Message ID, a file handle).  Also,
   (Group) OSCORE does not alter the fact that a CoAP response needs to
   come from where the corresponding CoAP request was sent, which simply
   follows from using transports where that is a requirement.

   Furthermore, two peers can seamlessly use (Group) OSCORE also in the
   presence of cross-proxies that change transport across different
   communication legs.  This does not affect the security processing at
   the (Group) OSCORE endpoints.

   Practically, (Group) OSCORE relies on the underlying CoAP
   implementation for obtaining received CoAP messages on which to
   perform the expected security processing.

   Upon receiving a protected message, the recipient endpoint retrieves
   the OSCORE Security Context to use for decryption based on key
   identifier information specified in the CoAP OSCORE Option of
   protected requests, and on the value of the CoAP Token of protected
   responses.

   In OSCORE, the key identifier information in request messages is
   typically limited to a "kid", with a value the OSCORE Sender ID
   associated with the message sender.  In case Sender IDs are not
   unique among different OSCORE Security Contexts stored by the same
   peer, it is possible to disambiguate by additionally using a "kid
   context" identifying the OSCORE Security Context as a whole.
   Instead, response messages are not required to convey key identifier
   information, as the client can rely on the Token conveyed in the
   response for retrieving the Security Context to use (see above).

   In Group OSCORE, the key identifier information in request messages
   always includes also a "kid context", whose value is used as
   identifier of the OSCORE group associated with the Security Context
   to use for security processing of the exchanged message.  Response
   messages are also required to convey a "kid" as key identifier
   information (i.e., the OSCORE Sender ID associated with the message
   sender), if the corresponding request was protected with the group
   mode of Group OSCORE (see Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]) .

   Some particular uses of (Group) OSCORE enable to build OSCORE-based
   tunneling [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-capable-proxies].  In such a case, a
   CoAP server might have to enforce that some OSCORE Security Contexts
   are not just looked up by a "kid" and similar key identifier

   information from the CoAP OSCORE Option in the incoming request to
   decrypt.  Such a lookup should also rely on the alleged client's
   address, or on an alternative identifier of the tunnel from which the
   request came from.

2.5.2.3.  Key Update

   Updating an OSCORE Security Context does not change or interfere with
   the values of the Token or Message ID used in the exchanged CoAP
   messages.  However, if long-term exchanges are involved (e.g., CoAP
   Observations [RFC7641]), one has to be careful to ensure that
   updating the Security Context does not impair the security properties
   of (Group) OSCORE or result in other security vulnerabilities.

   The following provides more details about key update, separately for
   OSCORE, KUDOS, and Group OSCORE.

   *  OSCORE: [RFC8613] tacitly assumes that two peers terminate any
      ongoing CoAP Observation that they still have ongoing, upon
      installing a new OSCORE Security Context, irrespective of the
      method used to perform the key update.

      On these premises, a belated response protected with the old
      OSCORE Security Context will fail decryption, as that Security
      Context is not available anymore on the receiving client.

   *  KUDOS: The key update protocol KUDOS allows the two OSCORE peers
      to negotiate about preserving their ongoing CoAP Observations
      across the performed key update.  If and only if both peers agree
      to do that during an execution of KUDOS, their Observations will
      remain active after installing the new OSCORE Security Context,
      which the two peers will use from then on to protect their
      exchanged Observe notifications.

      Furthermore, irrespective of the method used to perform a key
      update, Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] updates the
      security protocol OSCORE [RFC8613] in order to prevent security
      issues that can arise from misbinding a request and a response,
      when those are protected with two different OSCORE Security
      Contexts.

      Such an update to the OSCORE protocol requires a server to include
      its own Sender Sequence Number as Partial IV of an outgoing
      response, when protecting it with a Security Context different
      from the one used to protect the corresponding request.  An
      exception safely applies to the response messages that are sent
      when running the key update procedure defined in Appendix B.2 of
      [RFC8613].

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


   *  Group OSCORE: The Group Manager can distribute new group keying
      material to the members of an OSCORE group, by performing a group
      rekeying.  When receiving updated group keying material from the
      Group Manager, either upon joining the group or by participating
      in a group rekeying, a group member uses that material to install
      a new, commonly shared Group OSCORE Security Context, which
      replaces the old one (if any is stored).

      Also, Group OSCORE makes it possible for group members to safely
      preserve their ongoing active requests (e.g., CoAP Observations),
      also across the establishment of new Group OSCORE Security
      Contexts.  This is achieved by virtue of how the Group Manager
      assigns and maintains the identifiers of OSCORE groups (see
      Section 3.2.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

      Furthermore, analogous to the update that
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] makes on the OSCORE protocol
      with respect to protecting responses, Group OSCORE prevents
      security issues that can arise from misbinding a request and a
      response, when those are protected with two different Group OSCORE
      Security Contexts.

      In the same way specified in Section 3 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-key-update] for OSCORE, Group OSCORE
      requires a server to include its own Sender Sequence Number as
      Partial IV of an outgoing response, when protecting it with a
      Security Context different from the one used to protect the
      corresponding request (see Sections 8.3 and 9.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

2.5.3.  Eclipse/Californium

   Enhancements may be called for optimizations such as Eclipse/
   Californium EndpointContextMatcher [CF-MATCHER] might not work
   properly unless both sides of the communication agree on the extent
   of the matching boxes.  Mechanisms to indicate capabilities and
   choices selected may need to be defined; also, a way to define the
   progression of matching boxes needs to be defined that is compatible
   with the security properties of the underlying protocols.  This may
   require new efforts, to be initiated based on some formative
   contributions.

   PENDING.

   Relevant starting points for retrieving existing discussion of this
   issue include:

2.6.  RFC 7252-9.1/11.3: Handling outdated addresses and security
      contexts

   INCOMPLETE:  Tools for mitigating these scenarios were unavailable
      when CoAP originally was specified, and are now explained.

   PENDING.

   Information obtained about an established communication partner can
   experience continuity interruptions and become obsolete.  This can
   happen on different levels: For example, return routability
   information is lost when client's IP address changes; and information
   about whether a request was already handled can be lost when an
   OSCORE context is recovered as described in its Appendix B.1.2 of
   [RFC8613].  No matter the cause of the loss, a server still needs to
   maintain its security and amplification mitigation properties.

   The concerns addressed in the following subsections are independent
   on a specification level, but are described together because they can
   be addressed with the same tools -- moreover, a single round trip of
   using Echo in a response can address both at the same time.  In some
   scenarios, these are even expected to coincide.

   (move) A safe option is always to reject the initial request and
   request confirmation.  The RECOMMENDED way to do that is using CoAP's
   mechanism of sending a 4.01 (Unauthorized) response with an Echo
   option (where a subsequent request with the same Echo value proves to
   the server that the destination was reachable); clients SHOULD act to
   the Echo option as specified in [RFC9175].  Tools specific to a
   security protocol, such as RRC [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-rrc] in case of
   DTLS, may be used.  However, their use may depend on successful
   negotiation.

2.6.1.  Amplification mitigation and return routability

   CoAP servers have to mitigate the effects of traffic amplification as
   required in Section 11.3 of [RFC7252]; the maximum acceptable
   amplification factor of 3 is now the IETF consensus reflected for
   CoAP in Section 2.4 of [RFC9175], which can be summarized for this
   application as follows:

   If the server has learned that the client is reachable on the
   request's sender address, it can send a response.  Otherwise, if the
   response does not exceed the request's size by a factor of 3
   (Section 2.4 of [RFC9175], item 3), the server can answer the request
   successfully, but should still include an Echo value, whose presence
   in the next request serves to confirm the client's address.
   Otherwise, a 4.01 (Unautorized) error response with an Echo value is
   sent.

   Address verification is triggered both for new clients and for
   existing clients that changed their address.  This situation can
   happen at any time, especially after a prolonged period of
   quiescence, regardless of the security protocol.

   Verifying the client's address is not only crucial for mitigating
   amplification attacks [I-D.irtf-t2trg-amplification-attacks], but
   also to avoid traffic misdirection.  Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-rrc] describes options for how to use RRC messages
   to distinguish different cases.  A 4.01 response with Echo can
   perform some of the same functions, with the Echo value replacing the
   RRC cookie.  However, it does not offer a way to distinguish between
   non-preferred and preferred paths.  Where that distinction matters,
   RRC provides the right tools to make it.

2.6.2.  Replay protection

   Security mechanisms can offer trade-offs between performance and the
   security properties freshness and replay protection.  They sometimes
   use names such as "0RTT" (zero round-trip time).  With those
   mechanisms, the server recognizes that a request is sent in such a
   0RTT mode, but can still decide to send a response.  The general
   trade-off is that an attacker may intercept such a message and replay
   it at any later time, possibly multiple times, without the server
   having a reliable way of recognizing the replay.

   The semantics of CoAP are conducive to using such facilities: Safe
   requests are recognized by their request method code to not have side
   effects.  Nonetheless, more aspects need to be considered: There is
   no risk of metadata revealing data if the server answers a request
   multiple times.  Kinds of metadata to look out for are the size of



Bormann                  Expires 28 August 2025                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


   the response (which, in a replay situation, can give an active
   attacker additional data) as well as any processing delays.  (Side
   effects would also fall into that category, but there should not be
   any effects for safe requests).

   If nothing else, GET requests to constant resources, such as queries
   to /.well-known/core, can often be responded to safely on the CoAP
   layer even without any replay protection.

   There are resources for which more requests than those with safe
   request methods may be handled without replay protection, but as that
   assessment is hard to make, it is prudent to err at the side of
   caution.

   CoAP has no error code like HTTP's 425 Too Early with which a server
   could ask the client to resubmit its request later when all the
   security mechanism's guarantees are available.  Instead, servers can
   send 4.01 Unauthorized responses with Echo option; clients then
   repeat the request with the Echo value in the request.

   Appendix B.1.2 of [RFC8613] describes how this is used to recover
   loss of state in OSCORE.  Exceeding what is described there, a server
   can safely send a successful response, provided its criteria for 0RTT
   responses are met.  The server can still send an Echo option with the
   successful response: Only when the client repeats that Echo value in
   a subsequent response can the replay window be initialized.

   Implementers of OSCORE should be aware that answering potential
   replays can only be determined to be safe from the CoAP application's
   point of view.  As always, unless the sequence number in the request
   has just been removed from an initialized replay window, the response
   can not reuse the request's nonce, but needs to be sent with a new
   sequence number from the server's space.

   Requests with 0RTT properties currently cannot happen in DTLS because
   0-RTT Data is not allowed for CoAP (cf. Section 14 of
   [I-D.ietf-uta-tls13-iot-profile]).  However, that may change if a
   future document defines a profile for using early data with CoAP.

2.7.  RFC 7252-12.3: Content-Format Registry

   Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] established the CoAP Content-Formats
   Registry, which maps a combination of an Internet Media Type with an
   HTTP Content Coding, collectively called a Content-Format, to a
   concise numeric identifier for that Content-Format.  The "Media Type"
   is more than a Media-Type-Name (see [RFC9193] for an extensive
   discussion), i.e., it may contain parameters beyond the mere
   combination of a type-name and a subtype-name registered in



Bormann                  Expires 28 August 2025                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft   Corrections and Clarifications to CoAP    February 2025


   [IANA.media-types], as per [RFC6838], conventionally identified by
   the two names separated by a slash.  This construct is often called a
   Content Type to reduce the confusion with a Media-Type-Name (e.g., in
   Section 8.3 of [RFC9110], which then however also opts to use the
   term Media Type for the same information set).

   The second column of the Content-Format registry is the Content
   Coding, which is defined in Section 8.4.1 of [RFC9110].  For
   historical reasons, the HTTP header field that actually carries the
   content coding is called Content-Encoding; this often leads to the
   misnaming of Content Coding as "content encoding".

   As has been noted in [Err4954], the text in Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]
   incorrectly uses these terms in the context of content types and
   content coding:

   1.  The field that describes the Content Type is called "Media Type".
       This can lead to the misunderstanding that this column just
       carries a Media-Type-Name (such as "text/plain"), while it
       actually also can carry media type parameters (as in "text/plain;
       charset=UTF-8").

   2.  The field that describes the Content Coding uses the incorrect
       name "Content Encoding".

   INCORRECT, CORRECTED:
      The VERIFIED Errata Report [Err4954] corrects the usage of
      "Content-Encoding" in the text and changes the name of the first
      column of the Content-Format registry to "Content Type" and the
      name of the second field to "Content Coding".  This change has
      been carried out by IANA.

   [Err4954] also has some notes on what would be valid or invalid
   Content-Format registrations.  These are not repeated here; they are
   however quite useful as a reference when preparing additional
   Content-Format registrations.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no new requests to IANA.

   Individual clarifications may contain IANA considerations; as for
   example in Section 2.7.

   security aspects of the protocol.  As a consequence, the security
   considerations of the referenced RFCs apply without additions.
