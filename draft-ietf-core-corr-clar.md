--- abstract


RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC
7959, RFC 8132, and RFC 8323.
RFC 6690 defines the link format that is used in CoAP self-description
documents.

Some parts of the specification may be unclear or even contain errors
that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability
between different implementations.
The present document provides corrections, additions, and
clarifications to the RFCs cited; this document thus updates these
RFCs.
In addition, other clarifications related to the use of CoAP in other
specifications, including RFC 7390 and RFC 8075, are also provided.

# Introduction

{{-coap}} defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along
with a number of additional specifications, including {{-observe}},
{{-block}}, {{-etch}}, and {{-coap-tcp}}.
{{-link-format}} defines the link format that is used in CoAP
self-description documents.

During implementation and interoperability testing of these RFCs, and
in their practical use, some ambiguities and common misinterpretations
have been identified, as well as a few errors.

The present document summarizes identified issues and provides
corrections needed for implementations of CoAP to interoperate, i.e.,
it constitutes an update to the RFCs referenced.  This document also
provides other clarifications related to common misinterpretations of
the specification.  References to CoAP should, therefore, also include
this document.

In addition, some clarifications and corrections are also provided for
documents that are related to CoAP, including RFC 7390 and RFC 8075.

## Process

### Original text

The present document is an Internet-Draft, which is not intended to be
published as an RFC quickly.  Instead, it will be maintained as a
running document of the CoRE WG, probably for a number of years, until
the need for new entries tails off and the document can finally be
published as an RFC.  (This paragraph to be rephrased when that
happens.)

The status of this document as a running document of the WG implies a
consensus process that is applied in making updates to it.  The rest
of this subsection provides more details about this consensus process.
(This is the intended status; currently, the document is an individual submission only.)

(Consensus process TBD, but it will likely be based on an editor's
version in a publicly accessible git repository, as well as periodic
calls for consensus that lead to a new published Internet-Draft.)

### Proposed text based on IETF 117 and 2023-08-30 CoRE WG interim discussion

This section describes the process that will be used for developing
the present document (called "-corr-clar" colloquially).

This process might be revised as its execution progresses.

{: start="0"}
0. (Done as of this a draft): include the present process proposal.\\
   The document can then already be considered for WG adoption.

1. Go through the following available material and revise/create
   Github issues at [ISSUES] as needed:
    - Existing issues at [ISSUES]
        - More to be opened by Jon Shallow regarding Block-wise, see [JON-ISSUES]
    - CoAP FAQ at the CoRE WIKI [WIKI-FAQ]
        - Each point likely to become a new, short issue

2. Categorize the Github issues at [ISSUES] as to the topics they relate to, by tagging them.\\
Completing a first round of this will be a task for a dedicated team.

3. For each issue or set of issues at [ISSUES], confirm with the CoRE
   WG and gather feedback from affected protocol
   designers/implementors if the issue is best to be:
    - Included and covered in -corr-clar, as is or revised
    - Simply omitted in -corr-clar
    - Omitted in -corr-clar and left for a possible -bis document.\\
      (For example, this might be the case for some specific points related to RFC 7959.)

4. Reshape the -corr-clar document in order to reflect a sequence of
 pairs (Diagnosis, Therapy), where:
   - Diagnosis is the gist of a set of Github issues to cover, and
   - Therapy is the correction or clarification to address those.

   Even though at a high-level, the scope should be already clear by
   looking at the table of contents.
   That is, at this stage, there is no need to necessarily elaborate
   the Therapy in detail, but it is necessary to make a reader
   understand "what we are dealing with and taking which direction".

5. WG document work can then focus on improving the therapy parts,
   until all points are satisfactorily addressed and documented.

## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

When a section of this document makes formal corrections, additions
or invalidations to text in a referenced RFC, this is clearly summarized.
The text from the RFC that is being addressed is given and labeled
"INCOMPLETE", "INCORRECT", or "INCORRECT AND INVALIDATED", followed
by the correct text labeled "CORRECTED", where applicable.  When text
is added that does not simply correct text in previous
specifications, it is given with the label "FORMAL ADDITION".

Where a resolution has not yet been agreed, the resolution is marked PENDING.

In this document, a reference to a section in RFC nnnn is written
as RFC nnnn-\<number>, where \<number> is the section number.

# RFC 7252

## RFC7252-1.2: Terminology (Request-URI)

{{RFC7252}} uses the term "request URI" repeatedly, but only provides a
vague definition in {{Section 5.7.2 of RFC7252}}.
Text should be added to the definitions in {{Section 1.2 (Terminology)
of RFC7252}}.

{: vspace='0'}
INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION (Section 1.2):
: Request URI:
  : The URI that identifies a resource on a server intended to be
    addressed by a request; constructed from the context of the
    request combined with Options present in the request using the
    process defined in {{Section 6.5 (Composing URIs from Options) of
    RFC7252}}, see {{Section 5.7.2 (Forward-Proxies) of
    RFC7252}} for further details.
    Related to the HTTP concept of "target URI"; see {{Section 7.1
    (Determining the Target Resource) of ?RFC9110}}; previously called
    "effective request URI" in {{Section 5.5 (Effective Request URI) of
    ?RFC7230}}.

PENDING.

Note that a similar, but distinct concept is the "base URI", relative
to which relative URIs are resolved.
This is more complex in CoAP than in HTTP because CoAP can multicast
requests ({{Section 8 of -coap}}), expecting unicast responses; these need
to be interpreted relative to the unicast source address from which
the responses come.

{{Section 8.2 of -coap}} has:

{:quote}
>  For the purposes of interpreting the Location-* options and any links
   embedded in the representation, the request URI (i.e., the base URI
   relative to which the response is interpreted) is formed by replacing
   the multicast address in the Host component of the original request
   URI by the literal IP address of the endpoint actually responding.

Similarly, {{Section 8.2.1 of -coap}} (Caching) says:

{:quote}
>  A response received in reply to a GET request to a multicast group
   MAY be used to satisfy a subsequent request on the related unicast
   request URI.  The unicast request URI is obtained by replacing the
   authority part of the request URI with the transport-layer source
   address of the response message.

Further discussion of a more generalized response concept can be found in
{{-responses}}.


## RFC7252-5.10.5: Max-Age

In the discussion of {{-RC429}}, a comment was
made that it would be needed to define the point in time relative to
which Max-Age is defined.  A sender might reference it to the time it
actually sends the message containing the option (and paragraph 3 of
RFC7252-5.10.5 indeed requests that Max-Age be updated each time a
message is retransmitted).  The receiver of the message does not have
reliable information about the time of sending, though.  It may
instead reference the Max-Age to the time of reception.  This in
effect extends the time of Max-Age by the latency of the packet.
This extension was deemed acceptable for the purposes of {{-RC429}},
but may be suboptimal when Max-Age is about the lifetime of a response
object.

{:vspace}
INCOMPLETE:
: The value is intended to be current at the time of transmission.

PENDING.


## RFC7252-6.4: Decomposing URIs into Options

{{Err4895}} notes (text updated with newer link):

{:quote}
>
The current specification for decomposing a URI into CoAP Options
(Section 6.4) is correct; however the text may still be unclear to
implementers who may think that the phrase "not including the
delimiting slash characters" means simply omitting a trailing slash
character in the URI path. This is incorrect. See the discussion
outcome in email thread
> <https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/vqOiUreodGXqWZGeGOTREChCsKY/>.

{{Err4895}} proceeds to propose adding another note at the end of
{{Section 6.4 of RFC7252}}.
A slightly updated version of the proposed note might be:

{:vspace}
FORMAL ADDITION at the end of {{Section 6.4 of RFC7252}}:
: Also note that a trailing slash character in the \<path> component
  represents a separate, zero-character path segment (see the ABNF in
  {{Section 3.3 of -uri}}).
  This is encoded using a Uri-Path Option of zero length.
  The exception at the start of step 8 means that no such
  zero-character path segment is added for a trailing slash that
  immediately follows the authority (host and port).

  {:aside}
  > This exception means that, for a CoAP server, no difference is visible
  between a request that was generated from the URI
  `coap://authority/` and one that was generated from the URI
  `coap://authority` — in both cases, there is no Uri-Path Option in
  the request.
  (The URI continues to be parsed as defined:  e.g., for the URIs
  `coap://authority/?` and `coap://authority?`, there is no Uri-Path
  Option but a single Uri-Query Option that carries an empty query
  component.)
  >
  > Note that the exception at the start of step 8 does not mean that
  a client cannot create a request with a single empty Uri-Path
  Option; such a request just cannot be generated from a URI because
  of the algorithm given here.
  It also does not mean that a server is compelled to treat a request
  with such a single empty Uri-Path Option in the same way as one
  without any Uri-Path Option — the exception at the start of step 8
  is only about the process of generating a sequence of CoAP Options
  from a URI.
  >
  > The exception only applies to initial Uri-Path Options.
  So for `coap://authority/foo`, a single Uri-Path Option with the
  value `foo` is generated, while for `coap://authority/foo/` that
  Uri-Path Option is followed by an empty Uri-Path Option (an
  established idiom for a collection resource).
  >
  > Similarly, there is a difference between requests generated
  from `coap://authority/`, `coap://authority//`, and
  `coap://authority///`, respectively:
  The first has no Uri-Path Options (due to the special exception);
  the second, two (empty ones); the third, three (empty ones).
  No server is compelled to offer resources under URIs with
  multiple empty path name components, which would generally be
  considered weird.

## RFC7252-7.2.1: "ct" Attribute (content-format code)

As has been noted in {{Err5078}}, there is no information in {{RFC7252}}
about whether the "ct" target attribute can be present multiply or
not.

The text does indicate that the value of the attribute MAY be "a
space-separated sequence of Content-Format codes, indicating that
multiple content-formats are available", but it does not repeat the
prohibition of multiple instances that the analogously structured "rt"
and "if" attributes in {{Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of RFC6690}} have.

This appears to be an oversight.
Published examples in {{Section 4.1 of ?RFC9148}} and {{Section 4.3 of
?RFC9176}} further illustrate that the space-separated approach is
generally accepted to be the one to be used.
There is no gain to be had from allowing both variants, and it would
be likely to cause interoperability problems.

At the 2022-11-23 CoRE WG interim meeting, there was agreement that
{{Err5078}} should be marked "VERIFIED", which was done on 2023-01-18.

{:vspace}
INCOMPLETE; FORMAL ADDITION:
: The Content-Format code attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a
  link.

## RFC7252-9.1.1/9.1.2: (match boxing)

{{Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 of RFC7252}} provide details about using CoAP
over DTLS connections; in particular they restrict both message-id
matching and request/response matching to within a single combination
of DTLS session/DTLS epoch.

At the time, this was a decision to be very conservative based on the
wide variety of security implications a new DTLS epoch might have
(which also were not widely understood, e.g., for a re-authentication).
The normally short time between a request and a response made this
rather strict boxing appear acceptable.

However, with the Observe functionality {{-observe}}, it is quite likely
that significant time elapses between a request and the arrival of a
notification that is sent back as a response, causing a need for the
latter to use a different box from the original request.

Also, additions to CoAP such as CoAP over connection-oriented
transports {{-coap-tcp}} and OSCORE {{-oscore}} create similar matching
boxes that also do not fit certain likely use cases of these additions
(e.g., with short-lived TCP connections as discussed in {{Section 4.3
of ?RFC9006}}).

The match boxing semantics of the current protocol are clearly defined, but can be unsatisfactory given the current requirements.

This calls for careful design choices and enhancements when developing extensions for CoAP or protocols and methods applicable to CoAP, such as in the cases overviewed in the following {{match-boxing-oscore}} and {{match-boxing-eclipse}}.

### DTLS with Connection ID

PENDING:

{:aside}
>
Protocol mechanisms that have been defined for stitching
together connections or phases of an underlying connection, such
as Connection Identifiers for DTLS 1.2 {{RFC9146}}, may enable
keeping the session/epoch unchanged and even to change the
transport address (ip-address/port), once appropriately modified
match boxing rules are specified for the stitching mechanism.
(These rules either need to be defined to be implicitly active
for any use of the mechanism or they may require negotiation.)


### OSCORE, KUDOS, and Group OSCORE # {#match-boxing-oscore}

The security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) defined in {{-oscore}} provides end-to-end security for CoAP messages at the application level, by using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) {{-cose}}. In order to protect their communications, two peers need to have already established an OSCORE Security Context.

{{Section B.2 of -oscore}} provides an example for a key update procedure, which two OSCORE peers can run for establishing a new shared OSCORE Security Context that replaces their old one. The recent key update protocol KUDOS {{-kudos}} specifies how two OSCORE peers can establish a new shared OSCORE Security Context that replaces their old one, with a number of advantages compared to the method defined in {{Section B.2 of -oscore}}.

The security protocol Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) defined in {{-group-oscore}} builds on OSCORE and protects group communication for CoAP {{-groupcomm-bis}}. The management of the group keying material is entrusted to a Group Manager (see {{Section 3 of -group-oscore}}), which provides the latest group keying material to a new group member upon its group joining, and can update the group keying material by performing a group rekeying.

The following discusses how OSCORE, KUDOS, and Group OSCORE position themselves with respect to the match boxing, the transport used underlying CoAP, and the renewal of the keying material.

#### Match Boxing

The security processing of (Group) OSCORE is agnostic of the value assumed by the CoAP Token and Message ID. Also, (Group) OSCORE can be seamlessly used in the presence of (cross-)proxies that will change the value of the CoAP Token and Message ID on the different communication legs. This does not affect the security processing at the (Group) OSCORE endpoints.

Before any security processing is performed, the only use that (Group) OSCORE makes of the Token value is on the CoAP client upon receiving a response, in order to retrieve the right Security Context to use for decrypting and verifying the response.

Even in case the Token value in a CoAP response is manipulated to induce a Request-Response matching at the client, there is no risk for the client to successfully decrypt the response instead of failing as expected. This is because, per {{Section 12.3 of -oscore}}, the OSCORE Master Secret of each OSCORE Security Context is required not only to be secret, but also to have a good amount of randomness.

Building on that, an HKDF is used to derive the actual encryption keys
from the Master Secret and, optionally, from an additional Master
Salt. Furthermore, for each OSCORE Security Context, the quartet
(Master Secret, Master Salt, ID Context, Sender ID) must be unique. As
per {{Section 3.3 of -oscore}}, this is a hard requirement and
guarantees unique (key, nonce) pairs for the AEAD algorithm used.

In Group OSCORE, the Security Context extends that of OSCORE, and the same as above holds  (see {{Sections 2, 2.2, and 13.11 of -group-oscore}}).

Finally, (Group) OSCORE performs a separate secure match boxing under its own control, by cryptographically binding each protected request with all the corresponding protected responses. This is achieved by means of the COSE external_aad involved during the security processing of protected messages (see {{Section 5.4 of -oscore}} and {{Section 4.4 of -group-oscore}}).

#### Underlying Transport

The security protocol (Group) OSCORE does not have any requirement on
binding the Security Context in use to specific addressing information used by the transport protocol underlying CoAP. What occurs below (Group) OSCORE with transport-specific addressing information is transparent to (Group) OSCORE, but it needs to work well enough to ensure that received data is delivered to (Group) OSCORE for security processing.

Consistent with the above, (Group) OSCORE does not interfere with any low-layer, transport specific information. Instead, it entrusts data to a Request-Response exchange mechanism that can rely on different means to enforce the Request-Response matching at the transport level (e.g., the 5-tuple, the CoAP Message ID, a file handle). Also, (Group) OSCORE does not alter the fact that a CoAP response needs to come from where the corresponding CoAP request was sent, which simply follows from using transports where that is a requirement.

Furthermore, two peers can seamlessly use (Group) OSCORE also in the presence of cross-proxies that change transport across different communication legs. This does not affect the security processing at the (Group) OSCORE endpoints.

Practically, (Group) OSCORE relies on the underlying CoAP implementation for obtaining received CoAP messages on which to perform the expected security processing.

Upon receiving a protected message, the recipient endpoint retrieves the OSCORE Security Context to use for decryption based on key identifier information specified in the CoAP OSCORE Option of protected requests, and on the value of the CoAP Token of protected responses.

In OSCORE, the key identifier information in request messages is
typically limited to a "kid", with a value the OSCORE Sender ID associated with the message sender. In case Sender IDs are not unique among different OSCORE Security Contexts stored by the same peer, it is possible to disambiguate by additionally using a "kid context" identifying the OSCORE Security Context as a whole. Instead, response messages are not required to convey key identifier information, as the client can rely on the Token conveyed in the response for retrieving the Security Context to use (see above).

In Group OSCORE, the key identifier information in request messages always includes also a "kid context", whose value is used as identifier of the OSCORE group associated with the Security Context to use for security processing of the exchanged message. Response messages are also required to convey a "kid" as key identifier information (i.e., the OSCORE Sender ID associated with the message sender), if the corresponding request was protected with the group mode of Group OSCORE (see {{Section 8 of -group-oscore}}) .

Some particular uses of (Group) OSCORE enable to build OSCORE-based tunneling {{-oscore-proxies}}. In such a case, a CoAP server might have to enforce that some OSCORE Security Contexts are not just looked up by a "kid" and similar key identifier information from the CoAP OSCORE Option in the incoming request to decrypt. Such a lookup should also rely on the alleged client's address, or on an alternative identifier of the tunnel from which the request came from.

#### Key Update

Updating an OSCORE Security Context does not change or interfere with the values of the Token or Message ID used in the exchanged CoAP messages. However, if long-term exchanges are involved (e.g., CoAP Observations {{-observe}}), one has to be careful to ensure that updating the Security Context does not impair the security properties of (Group) OSCORE or result in other security vulnerabilities.

The following provides more details about key update, separately for OSCORE, KUDOS, and Group OSCORE.

* OSCORE: {{-oscore}} tacitly assumes that two peers terminate any ongoing CoAP Observation that they still have ongoing, upon installing a new OSCORE Security Context, irrespective of the method used to perform the key update.

  On these premises, a belated response protected with the old OSCORE
  Security Context will fail decryption, as that Security Context is not available anymore on the receiving client.

* KUDOS: The key update protocol KUDOS allows the two OSCORE peers to negotiate about preserving their ongoing CoAP Observations across the performed key update. If and only if both peers agree to do that during an execution of KUDOS, their Observations will remain active after installing the new OSCORE Security Context, which the two peers will use from then on to protect their exchanged Observe notifications.

  Furthermore, irrespective of the method used to perform a key update, {{Section 3 of -kudos}} updates the security protocol OSCORE {{-oscore}} in order to prevent security issues that can arise from misbinding a request and a response, when those are protected with two different OSCORE Security Contexts.

  Such an update to the OSCORE protocol requires a server to include its own Sender Sequence Number as Partial IV of an outgoing response, when protecting it with a Security Context different from the one used to protect the corresponding request. An exception safely applies to the response messages that are sent when running the key update procedure defined in {{Section B.2 of -oscore}}.

* Group OSCORE: The Group Manager can distribute new group keying material to the members of an OSCORE group, by performing a group rekeying. When receiving updated group keying material from the Group Manager, either upon joining the group or by participating in a group rekeying, a group member uses that material to install a new, commonly shared Group OSCORE Security Context, which replaces the old one (if any is stored).

  Also, Group OSCORE makes it possible for group members to safely
  preserve their ongoing active requests (e.g., CoAP Observations), also across the establishment of new Group OSCORE Security Contexts. This is achieved by virtue of how the Group Manager assigns and maintains the identifiers of OSCORE groups (see {{Section 3.2.1.1 of -group-oscore}}).

  Furthermore, analogous to the update that {{-kudos}} makes on the OSCORE protocol with respect to protecting responses, Group OSCORE prevents security issues that can arise from misbinding a request and a response, when those are protected with two different Group OSCORE Security Contexts.

  In the same way specified in {{Section 3 of -kudos}} for OSCORE, Group OSCORE requires a server to include its own Sender Sequence Number as Partial IV of an outgoing response, when protecting it with a Security Context different from the one used to protect the corresponding request (see {{Sections 8.3 and 9.5 of -group-oscore}}).

### Eclipse/Californium # {#match-boxing-eclipse}

Enhancements may be called for optimizations such as Eclipse/Californium EndpointContextMatcher {{CF-MATCHER}} might not work properly unless both sides of the communication agree on the extent of the matching boxes. Mechanisms to indicate capabilities and choices selected may need to be defined; also, a way to define the progression of matching boxes needs to be defined that is compatible with the security properties of the underlying protocols. This may require new efforts, to be initiated based on some formative contributions.

## RFC 7252-9.1/11.3: Handling outdated addresses and security contexts {#amp-0rtt}

INCOMPLETE:
: Tools for mitigating these scenarios were unavailable when specified, and are now explained.

PENDING.

Established security contexts and established return addresses can become obsolete.
For example, this happens when a DTLS session is resumed via CIDs, when the client's IP address changes, or when the replay window of an OSCORE context is lost and recovered through the mechanism of {{Appendix B.1.2 of RFC8613}}.
In those situations, a server still needs to maintain its security and amplification mitigation properties,
which are generally independent concerns but can be addressed using the same tools.

A safe option is always to reject the initial request and request confirmation.
The RECOMMENDED way to do that is using CoAP's mechanism of sending a 4.01 (Unauthorized) response with an Echo option
(where a subsequent request with the same Echo value proves to the server that the destination was reachable);
clients SHOULD act to the Echo option as specified in {{?RFC9175}}.
Tools specific to a security protocol, such as RRC {{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-rrc}} in case of DTLS, may be used. However, their use may depend on successful negotiation.

### Amplification mitigation and return routability

If it is not certain that the client is reachable on the request's sender address,
but the response does not exceed the request's size by a factor of 3 ({{Section 2.4 of RFC9175}}, item 3),
the server can answer the request.
It should still include an Echo value, whose presence in the next request serves to confirm the client's address.

This situation can happen at any time, especially after a prolonged period of quiescence, regardless of the security protocol.

Verifying the client's address is not only crucial for mitigating amplification attacks {{I-D.irtf-t2trg-amplification-attacks}}, but also to avoid traffic misdirection.
{{Section 7 of I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-rrc}} describes options for how to use RRC messages to distinguish different cases.
A 4.01 response with Echo can perform some of the same functions, with the Echo value replacing the RRC cookie. However, it does not offer a way to distinguish between non-preferred and preferred paths.
Where that distinction matters,
RRC provides the right tools to make it.

### Replay protection

If it is not certain that the request is not a replay,
but the request handler is safe
and there is no risk of metadata revealing data,
the server can answer the request.
Kinds of metadata to look out for are the size of the response
(which, in a replay situation, can give an active attacker additional data)
as well as any processing delays.
(Side effects would also fall into that category, but there should not be any effects for safe requests).

If nothing else, GET requests to constant resources,
such as queries to /.well-known/core,
can often be responded to safely on the CoAP layer even without any replay protection.

There are resources for which more requests than those with safe codes may be handled without replay protection,
but as that assessment is hard to make, it is prudent to err at the side of caution.

Uncertainty about whether a request might be a replay can happen in OSCORE after a partial loss of context.
Currently, this cannot happen in DTLS because 0-RTT Data is not allowed for CoAP (cf. {{Section 14 of ?I-D.ietf-uta-tls13-iot-profile-09}}). However, that may change if a future document defines a profile for using early data with CoAP.

Implementers of OSCORE should be aware that answering potential replays is only safe from the CoAP application's point of view.
As always, unless the sender sequence number of the request has just been removed from a correctly initialized replay window,
the response can not reuse the request's nonce, but needs to take a separate sequence number from the server's space.

## RFC 7252-12.3: Content-Format Registry {#ct}

{{Section 12.3 of RFC7252}} established the CoAP Content-Formats
Registry, which maps a combination of an Internet Media Type
with an HTTP Content Coding, collectively called a Content-Format, to
a concise numeric identifier for that Content-Format.
The "Media Type" is more than a Media-Type-Name (see {{?RFC9193}} for an
extensive discussion), i.e., it may contain parameters beyond the mere
combination of a type-name and a subtype-name registered in
{{?IANA.media-types}}, as per {{?RFC6838}}, conventionally identified by
the two names separated by a slash.
This construct is often called a Content Type to reduce the confusion
with a Media-Type-Name (e.g., in {{Section 8.3 of ?RFC9110}}, which then
however also opts to use the term Media Type for the same information set).

The second column of the Content-Format registry is the Content
Coding, which is defined in {{Section 8.4.1 of ?RFC9110}}.
For historical reasons, the HTTP header field that actually carries
the content coding is called Content-Encoding; this often leads to the
misnaming of Content Coding as "content encoding".

As has been noted in {{Err4954}}, the text in {{Section 12.3 of RFC7252}}
incorrectly uses these terms in the context of content types and
content coding:

1. The field that describes the Content Type is called "Media Type".
   This can lead to the misunderstanding that this column just carries
   a Media-Type-Name (such as "`text/plain`"), while it actually also
   can carry media type parameters (as in "`text/plain; charset=UTF-8`").

2. The field that describes the Content Coding uses the incorrect name
   "Content Encoding".

{:vspace}
INCORRECT, CORRECTED:
: The VERIFIED Errata Report {{Err4954}} corrects the usage of
  "Content-Encoding" in the text and changes the name of the first
  column of the Content-Format registry to "Content Type" and the name
  of the second field to "Content Coding".
  This change has been carried out by IANA.

{{Err4954}} also has some notes on what would be valid or invalid
Content-Format registrations.
These are not repeated here; they are however quite useful as a
reference when preparing additional Content-Format registrations.

# IANA Considerations

This document makes no new requests to IANA.

Individual clarifications may contain IANA considerations; as for
example in {{ct}}.

# Security Considerations

This document provides a number of corrections and clarifications to
existing RFCs, but it does not make any changes with regard to the security
aspects of the protocol.  As a consequence, the security
considerations of the referenced RFCs apply without additions.

(To be changed when that is no longer true; probably the security
considerations will then be on the individual clarifications.)
